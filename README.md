# Forge
Forge generates a randomised fake profile to use for signing up for services and websites that you don't want to disclose your real details to. This protects your privacy, and stops your email becoming filled with spam. Forge utilises Guerrilla Mail to provide a temporary, disposable email address - allowing you to sign up, and verify,  with services that require an email.
